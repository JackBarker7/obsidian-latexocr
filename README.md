# obsidian-latexocr

A simple [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin to run [LaTeX-OCR](https://github.com/lukas-blecher/LaTeX-OCR) if it is installed locally. This allows equations compiled by $\LaTeX$ from an image to be converted to raw $\LaTeX$ code that can then be used in a markdown file.

# Features

- Adds a button in the left ribbon to execute `latexocr`
- Adds a command to the command palette to execute `latexocr`
- Adds optional status text to the status bar to show if LaTeX-OCR is running. Status text can be added/removed via a setting.
